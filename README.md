JavascriptTTC
=============

These are programs written for the Javascript class at Trident Technical College.

I finished this class with a 95 average. I made a 100 on most assignments, a 90 on the midterm, and a 98 on the final. Most assignments have the Javascript written within the html file because it was a requirement by the professor; I know, however, it is best practice to have a separate .js file.
