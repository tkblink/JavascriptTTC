			<u>Here is a little information about me: </u>
		</h2>

			<h3>
				I live with my wonderful fiance Brittiny in Charleston SC.  I enjoy learning anything I can about computers. I also love playing video games, riding bikes, and sailing.  
				<br>
				<br>
				Currently I am taking programming classes at Trident Technical College and I am a student at Charleston Code Camp. I have taken classes for the following: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Javascript, Java, and C++. I get additional practice through W3Schools.com and Codecademy.com. I have some experience with GitHub (username: tkblink) and XAMP webstack. I am familiar with Windows and Linux operating systems.
				<br>
				<br>
				I am currently employed at Trident Technical College's IT department through work-study. In the past I have been a Help Desk Support Contractor for MUSC through TEKsystems, an Inventory Manager at PETCO, and I have worked food industry jobs for years. I have over a decade of customer service under my belt!
				<br>
				<br>
				In the near future I would like an entry level position in front-end development;  I have a special interest in UI/UX design and web development. I have a Bachelor's of Science in Psychology (Human Factors) with a Minor in Business Administration from Clemson University. I began Clemson as a Computer Science major where I learned Java and discovered my passion for Human Factors/UI/UX Design.
